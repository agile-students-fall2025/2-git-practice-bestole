## Assigned Reading: Therac-25 Case Study

[Read the Article](http://sunnyday.mit.edu/papers/therac.pdf)

This article was assigned reading in my Operating Systems class with Professor Walfish. It's a very interesting case study on the Therac-25 system â€” a computer-controlled radiation therapy machine produced by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited.

The machine killed multiple people due to issues, including but not limited to:

- Lack of governmental regulations
- Race conditions
- The software being developed by a single programmer
- Poorly documented code
- Cryptic error messages

If you've already taken OS and haven't read this paper, you should read this. This paper put into perspective for me (and probably will for you too) how serious it is to create sound software is in certain scenarios.

## Additional Perspective from Eslem

I found this article particularly insightful, I already read this paper for my OS class. I believe this is a great example to show consequinces of irresponsible and inconsidered work.
